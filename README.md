# Stock-Analysis
Stock Movement, Data analysis &amp; Clustering


This is small project that I am writing for my personal finance, I created a small fuctions that will caclculate moving averages (pass a list) and return a multi-level columns with SMD## moving average information.


Disclosure: This is my personal insights and they must not be taken for granted, I am not a financial advisor. 


- MultiAverage fuctions  : Return the Multi Average data frame 
- Above50 : return stock which close > 50DMA
- _MACD_ : calculate and return mcad with  fastperiod = 12 , slowperiod = 24 , signalperiod = 9
